Response data: {
    "verdict": "Misleading",
    "why": [
        "Butter is advertised prominently, but constitutes only 2% of the ingredients.",
        "Contains prominent amounts of unhealthy ingredients such as refined wheat flour and sugar."
    ],
    "detailed_analysis": "Although the product is named 'Butter Biscuit', the actual butter content 
    is minimal at only 2%. The primary ingredients are less healthy options like refined wheat flour 
    and palm oil, suggesting the product may not provide the wholesome benefits often associated with 
    butter. Additionally, prominent advertising of butter could mislead consumers into thinking the 
    product is richer in butter than it is, potentially affecting both taste expectations and perceived 
    healthfulness."

Response data: {
  "verdict": "Misleading",
  "why": [
    "Product is not 100% cocoa as it contains an additional artificial flavour."
  ],
  "detailed_analysis": "Weikfield Cocoa Powder claims to be predominantly 'Cocoa Solids,' 
  but the inclusion of an artificial chocolate flavouring adds a component that is not pure cocoa.
   While the percentage of this artificial ingredient might be small, it still means the 
   product cannot be considered as 100% pure cocoa. This may mislead consumers who are seeking 
   pure cocoa products for their health benefits or for culinary purposes.
